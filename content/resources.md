# Resources

"The more you learn, the less you know you don't know." - Daniel Kahneman

These resources might be useful if you are a developer, or maybe you're just interested in what I'm reading.

## Books

I'm attempting to raise my nerd level ðŸ¤“ by reading these books.

- Clean Code
- Design Patterns
- The Imposter's Handbook
- Designing Data Intensive Applications
- The DevOps Handbook

Despite my humorous tone, all of the above are truly valuable for any dev.  
None of them are easy reads though.

## Platforms

I have bought a life-time subscription to Laracasts.
