# Resources

> "The more you learn, the less you know you don't know." - Daniel Kahneman

These resources might be useful if you are a developer, or maybe you're just interested in what I'm reading.  
This is how I stay on top of things.

## Books

I'm attempting to raise my nerd level ðŸ¤“ by reading these books.  
Despite my humorous tone, all are truly valuable for any dev.  
None of them are easy reads though.

- Clean Code - Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin
- Design Patterns - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
- The Imposter's Handbook - Rob Conery
- Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann
- The DevOps Handbook - Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis

## Platforms

I have bought a life-time subscription to Laracasts.
