# :brain: Resources

> "The more you learn, the less you know you don't know." - Daniel Kahneman

These resources might be useful if you are a developer, or maybe you're just interested in what I'm reading.

This is how I stay on top of things.

## :book: Books

I'm attempting to raise my nerd level :icon{name="fluent-emoji:nerd-face"} by reading these books.

Despite my humorous tone, all are truly valuable for any dev. None of them are easy reads though.

::list{icon=ph:check-circle-duotone}
- Clean Code - Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin
- Design Patterns - Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
- The Imposter's Handbook - Rob Conery
- Designing Data Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann
- The DevOps Handbook - Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, and John Willis
