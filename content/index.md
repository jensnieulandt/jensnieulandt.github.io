# Jens Nieulandt

Developer

Hi, I'm Jens, a software developer from Belgium. I enjoy collaborating with others to create high-quality web applications and technical integrations. I advocate for automated testing, readable code, good documentation, and clear standards. In my free time, I experiment with AI and embedded systems.

This website offers an overview of my technical journey.

## Trilations (2021 - today)

I'm currently working at [Trilations](https://www.trilations.com), a fast-growing consultancy firm. I'm part of the pharma-focused branch of the company.

My team, specifically, is a bunch of enthusiasts dedicated to optimizing a single (privately licensed) application used internationally carrying the name T-App. We also maintain internal tools and try to be the driving force for automation.

So far, I have worked on porting T-App to the latest PHP version. I am trying to get the team on board with automated testing. I'm creating a structure for documentation, and I'm reworking the DevOps setup. Wish me luck!

## Springbok Agency (2019 - 2021)

I was eager to get into a more specialized role, which is what I did at Springbok. The Mechelen-based agency allowed me to focus on full-stack development for Pan-European customers, primarily using Laravel and Vue.js. I was fortunate to gain hands-on DevOps experience using tools like Github, Envoyer, and Azure DevOps. Because of my previous experience, I also spent time porting legacy software. I introduced automated testing to the company culture and tech stack. While I also supported and mentored multiple junior developers.

One of the largest, technologically diverse projects I worked on is the website of Bridgestone's European & Middle-Eastern branches. The team built this website with corporate-level headless back-end and web components.

## Deltacom (2018 - 2019)

At Deltacom, the team was small, that naturally made my role very fluent. Next to being the main point of contact for clients, I was responsible for full stack development for business front- and back-end solutions used by over 20k users (websites, web apps, and member management systems). Additionally, I developed and maintained software for a collection company. I also worked on porting legacy PHP projects to the Symfony framework, and I was tasked with reverse engineering databases and optimizing server load. I created an embedded solution used to scan tickets at events.

To complete my work, I used a variety of technologies, including PHP/Symfony, MySQL/MariaDB, and jQuery. I also introduced versioning and a data redundancy plan for all software maintained by the company.

## Chuck (2017)

My first professional experience was an internship as a web developer. At Chuck, I added documentation to existing projects and created websites in Laravel and Angular.
